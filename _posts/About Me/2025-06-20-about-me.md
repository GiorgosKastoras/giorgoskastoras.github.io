Hello, my name is George Kastoras! 

Iâ€™m a Data Analyst with a Bachelor's degree in Finance. My goal is to transform raw data into meaningful insights that drive smart business decisions.

I have experience in data analysis and wrangling, using Excel, SQL, and Python to clean and interpret complex datasets. I also specialize in data visualization and storytelling, leveraging Excel, Power BI, and Looker to present insights in a clear and compelling way.

Beyond technical skills, I excel in collaborative environments, bringing communication, adaptability, and problem-solving abilities to every project. My analytical mindset, attention to detail, and time management help me tackle challenges efficiently and effectively.
